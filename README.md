# football-plugin-minecraft

This is a football plugin for minecraft that I made for somebody. Most likely doesn't work in it's current form due to not being maintained and having deprecated methods and dependency issues. It was done prior to me having this github account, so I am uploading it in it's entirety here.

Made in Java, using the SPIGOT/BUKKIT api and BattleArena api as well.
